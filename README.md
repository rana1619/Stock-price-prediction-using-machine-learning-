# Stock-price-prediction-using-machine-learning-
In stock price prediction, the aim is to predict the future value of the financial stocks of a company.  The recent trend in stock market prediction is the use of machine learning which makes the prediction based on the values of current stock market indices by training on their previous values. Machine learning itself employs different models to make prediction easier and authentic.  In our project we are using LSTM based machine learning approach to predict stock values.  We are going to predict the closing price of the stock for a day with prediction of at least one week in advance. Will be using optimizer = ‘adam’.
